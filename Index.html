The nature of the dilemma of Schrodinger’s Cat is, like much else in the quantum world, one of measurement. In the case of Schrodinger’s Cat, the instrument used for measurement is human consciousness. The observer peeks in the box, light hits the retina, and the retina sends signals to the brain, and the brain forms an idea of the cat being either alive or dead. As it is now, a human consciousness is capable of seeing a cat only as either dead or alive, because that’s the way our consciousness manifests. I cannot see a cat as both dead and alive at the same time, which is why the case of Schrodinger’s Catbefuddles those who study it, because quantum theory tells us that the cat is simultaneously dead and alive until the instant that we open the box and peek inside.</p>

            But why is the case of Schrodinger’s Cat so ‘spooky’ in the first place? It is so because our consciousness interprets it as such. If human consciousness assumed a different manifestation, if, say, it had evolved a little differently, or a little more elaborately, we could hypothetically be able to see the whole amplitude, to see the cat both dead and alive at the same time, and it might not be all that spooky to consider that a cat might be dead or alive at the same time, because that’s how we would see everything, not necessarily as dead and alive, but in multiple and simultaneous potential states of existence. But, because our consciousness in its current state cannot see it like so, our consciousness will reduce the amplitude to a state that it’s capable of interpreting, and when we consider that the cat was in multiple states at the same time just a second ago, it’s befuddling.

        <h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Our consciousness could one day, with enough evolution or reconfiguring, see the entirety of a situation, or at least much more than we see now. Think of it like this: Lesser consciousnesses (like ‘lower’ animals) do not have the same cognitive processing skills that humans have. They lack the ability to see a hypothetical situation from multiple angles. But evolved humans can see a situation from multiple angles. So if I watch an intriguing movie scene, I’m able to interpret that scene from many different viewpoints (reasons why it’s good, why it’s bad), all of which might contradict each other, but all of which would be technically correct based on my state of consciousness.</p>
