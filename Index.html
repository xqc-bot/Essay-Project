cat
The nature of the dilemma of Schrodinger’s Cat is, like much else in the quantum world, one of measurement. In the case of Schrodinger’s Cat, the instrument used for measurement is human consciousness. The observer peeks in the box, light hits the retina, and the retina sends signals to the brain, and the brain forms an idea of the cat being either alive or dead. As it is now, a human consciousness is capable of seeing a cat only as either dead or alive, because that’s the way our consciousness manifests. I cannot see a cat as both dead and alive at the same time, which is why the case of Schrodinger’s Catbefuddles those who study it, because quantum theory tells us that the cat is simultaneously dead and alive until the instant that we open the box and peek inside.</p>
